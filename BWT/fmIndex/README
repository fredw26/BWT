Edit the script index.sh to reference the filenames of both your BWT (in all
capital letters) and your reads (each read on a new line, all caps). The
indexer will store a file called index.txt after its first run so that it can
run more quickly subsequent times. If you wish to run the program with a
different BWT, be sure to delete index.txt beforehand.
